# Icon Files

Place your application icons here:

- `icon.png` - PNG format icon (at least 512x512px recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows ICO format (multi-resolution)

You can use online tools to convert PNG to ICO:
- https://convertico.com/
- https://icoconvert.com/

## Creating Icons

### Using GIMP (Free)
1. Create a 512x512px image
2. Design your icon (consider using DMC logo or disaster management symbols)
3. Export as PNG
4. Use online converter for ICO format

### Using Photoshop
1. Create a 512x512px document
2. Design your icon
3. Save as PNG
4. Use plugin or online tool for ICO

### Icon Design Suggestions
- Use colors: Blue (protection), Orange (emergency), Green (safety)
- Include symbols: Shield, cross, medical, box/package
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

### Temporary Solution
For now, the application will work without custom icons. Electron will use default icons.
To add icons later, simply place them in this folder and rebuild the application.
